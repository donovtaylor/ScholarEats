# CSC 648-848 Milestone 5 Instructions Spring 2024 – Final Demo and Documents for Grading

**Delivery:** Thursday 05/23/2024 at 9:00 am.. Hard deadline!!!

Milestone 5 consists of:

1. Zoom link with a recording of your demo presentation showcasing your unique feature.
2. Delivery of your final project.
3. Complete documentation for your project called M5.pdf (see below for more details).

Copy your code to some other server after you submit M5, in case we will be shutting down your servers in Github to make room for the next semester. Make sure you have the code in Github well organized, Milestone 5 deliverables (documentation, your code in Github etc.) becomes your portfolio which is very useful for your job search and to showcase your work when you are interviewing for a Junior SW Engineering position. Don’t forget to update your CV accordingly.

## Delivery 1: Demo of your application

Each team will spend a total of NO MORE THAN 15 min to demo their application *** this a hard time limit ****. This is a graded component that is part of the delivery of your product. The demo must run from the deployment server. To show how your app renders on mobile show it to the audience by resizing the browser or on your mobile.

This presentation is intended to simulate a trade show, where you are featuring your “product” to a captive target audience (citizens, buyers, VC funders, buying managers, etc.)

This is the first time your “company” is presenting. Therefore, the focus of the demo is on usability and showcasing the unique features and key functionality of your application, not on the technical details of the implementation. However, at the end of your presentation please describe what was special in your implementations and outline key challenges you had – this segment should be done verbally, with NO slides.

I suggest this plan for your demo:

1. First introduce yourself and the team, ask them to stand up.
2. Tell us briefly about your application – kind of executive summary
3. Pick up main use cases for your unique features (see class material) and run the demo by following these typical use cases. (Please do not dwell on registration or login processes, we all know how it works. Do not lose time typing in registration information, that is trivial and boring).
4. After demo is done, members of the team (not only the presenter) will tell us how the team worked and what was hard and challenging and how you addressed. Tell us what you would do differently next time (base this on your section “Lesson learned” from M5 document, see below)

**DO NOT demo registration. When login is needed login as existing user**

Some important things regarding the presentation “mechanics”:

- Test your demo on some neutral (not yours) laptop to ensure it works for everybody.
- Most teams prefer one person to talk, and its recommended this way.
- Your system must work from the deployment server. This will be checked during your presentation.
- Presenters: speak clearly, and with loud voice. You have to “sell” your application - this is the key moment for your young company. Practice the talk and make sure you finish the demo in 15 min.
- Do not use slides or queue card - focus on the audience running the demo.
- Make it fun and engaging for the type of audience you have.

Instructor will take notes about your demo and use for grading as per grading rubrics. Independent graders may also evaluate your demo offline and will provide feedback on your application/product.

## Delivery 2: Folder with complete project documentation – “M5 folder”

Please note that we use this final documentation for grading, both its content and format, as per rubrics we published. Make sure no required section is missing.

It is the responsibility of the team lead to collect all required documents that will be delivered in M5. The final M5 folder in your repository must have a m5.pdf file with the following content and format (adherence to required content and format is graded, including cover page). Failure to follow exact format (including the title page and its placement) and content or missing some items will reduce the team grade.

Note also that this folder becomes your valuable portfolio that you should use in your job search.

### 1) Cover page (placed on the outer page of the folder) containing:

- Title: “Final Project for SW Engineering Class CSC 648-848 Spring 2024”
- Team number
- Name of your application
- Names of all members with the team lead first (with team lead’s e-mail)
- URL of the project
- URL of the Zoom recording with your demo presentation
- Date

### 2) Product summary: Please copy this section from M4V2 (it is put here again for completeness of M5)

- Name of the product
- Explicit list of ALL major committed functions (your FINAL P1 functions for which you will be graded) your team shall actually deliver (and test for) (you should use plain English and not language used for formal specs, like if you would talk to a customer). This is your FINAL functional commitment. Present this in a list format, with each item max 1-3 lines.
- What is unique in your product
- URL to your product

The list of final functions will be checked on your final delivery for functionality and correct operation as you specified them. Failure to deliver complete list of these committed functions may result in reduced grade.

### 3) Milestone documents – M1-M4 (Versions 2 only)

M1V2, M2V2, M3V2, M4V2 - please only include V2 of your milestones, DO NOT include frozen versions (V1s). You must embed your V2s milestones pdf files into M5.pdf in this section. Do not worry if the page numbering from your V2 milestones doesn’t match with the page numbering of M5.

### 4) Team member contributions

In this section, the team lead MUST provide a high level descriptions of the contributions provided by every member of the team for the whole semester in the milestones and project. In addition, the team lead must provide a general score 1-10 that represents the contribution (in general) of the team member to all the work done during the semester. Note, this score is not only about M5. This score represents the contribution of the team members for the whole semester including M5 contribution. This will be checked by the instructor for accuracy using commits and other tools. If we find out that team members are covering up other team’s members, then the team leads will have points deducted from their individual grades because they would not be meeting their responsibilities as team leads.

Finally, the team lead must collect the signatures of all the team members to agree with these scores provided. This signatures must be added to the document in this section. If there is a disagreement, it must be addressed to the instructor via email (CC’d in the email all the parties involved in the disagreement) before the deadline of M5. The instructor will be unable to discuss disagreements on this matter after the deadline.

In this milestone, there is no need to email the instructor with feedback or complaints, but you are welcome to do so if you have something important to say.

### 5) Post analysis – lessons learned (one page or so)

In many organizations, after the project is done, people engage in analysis of the experience, issues, and lessons learned. In the classroom, one often learns more from mistakes….but for real learning to happen one needs to be able to understand what mistakes were made and what would need to be done to avoid them in the future… BTW: this is also worthy of discussion in your job interviews – employers love those real stories about challenges and how there were dealt with.

In about one page team lead should summarize: a) main challenges; and b) what would he/she do better next time to address those challenges. Team lead should consult with team members before completing this. Please be honest and identify issues and mistakes, this will help your learning.

Team lead writes this section!!!

Note: in M5 there is no need to send an email to the instructor as done in other milestones. All your work needs to be in your repository by the deadline.

Thank you for your hard work this semester and good luck!!!!!!!!
