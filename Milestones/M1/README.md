# Milestone 1 

## This document contains general info about checkpoint #1 and checkpoint #2

Checkpoint #1 General Objectives: 

a) initial high-level personas and use cases 

b) from use cases develop high level functional requirements for the application 

c) list high level architecture, frameworks and tools to be used (generally the same as in M1) 

d) get the teamwork going. Note that these are only high-level requirements and specs with the idea to get early feedback and iterate before investing in developing more detailed specs and first prototype in Milestone 2. Future designs can deviate from Milestone 1 in the spirit of iterative SW design and development.

Initial input for your work is the instructor guidance, class slides on the topics as well as your SW and tool selection for M1. For use cases and functional specs, feel free to also use your own ideas, research similar applications that already exist, talk to your friends etc. Please consult class material on Use Cases, Requirements and Specs.

This is the first team milestone. The whole student team submits one milestone document for each Milestone 1 – 5, submission details are below.

You will discuss ongoing work on Milestone 1 during team session in each class, and you can also send e-mail to instructor with questions. Document formatting (page numbers, table of contents, each section starts in a new page….) is really important when you submit technical documentation like the one in M1.
