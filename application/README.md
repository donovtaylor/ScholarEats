# Application Folder

## Purpose
The purpose of this folder is to store all the source code and related files for your team's application. Code for prototypes is not allowed in this folder. This folder must contain only working and tested code. <strong>YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED</strong>

You are free to organize the contents of the folder as you see fit. But remember your team is graded on how you use Git. This does include the structure of your application. Points will be deducted from poorly structured application folders.

## Please use the rest of the README.md to store important information for your team's application.
