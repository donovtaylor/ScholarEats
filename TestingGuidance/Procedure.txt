First, a task will be created on Notion by the *Team Lead* or *Github Master* and a feature branch 
corresponding to that task will be created.

Team-members will be assigned to be *maintainers* that task and work on that specific branch.

Once the maintainer(s) believe that the feature has been properly implemented, the maintainer will go
examine the *current* checklist for testing.

This checklist will be contained in the "TestingGuidance" folder in the repository within "Checklist.txt"

Please note that this checklist will be periodically updated and merged into main via the 
"testingGuidance" branch.

Once the maintainer(s) has completed the checklist, the maintainer will create a GitHub Pull Request(PR)
requesting that the feature branch be merged into main.

The PR will be approved and merged by either the Team Lead or the GitHub Master.
At least (1) approval is required to do any merging into main branch.
